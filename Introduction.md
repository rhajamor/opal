# Introduction #

The goal of this project is to add some widgets that are not part of SWT or part of Eclipse Nebula.

I used some of these widgets in my professional projects, the others are divided in 2 families :
  * Original widgets (dual list, panels...)
  * Converted widgets from Swing or from other languages : Dual List, Dialog Box, ...

All this code is covered by the Eclipse Public Licence.
