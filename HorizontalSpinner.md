This widget is a horizontal spinner. Excepts its look (the buttons are located on both side of the text area), it has the same behaviour and methods than the [Spinner](http://help.eclipse.org/helios/topic/org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/reference/api/org/eclipse/swt/widgets/Spinner.html) widget.

An example called **HorizontalSpinnerSnippet.java** can be found in the directory **src/test/java/org/mihalis/opal/horizontalSpinner**.

This example is also available here : http://code.google.com/a/eclipselabs.org/p/opal/source/browse/src/test/java/org/mihalis/opal/horizontalSpinner/HorizontalSpinnerSnippet.java
