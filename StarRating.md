A simple star rating toolbar that allows the user to rate anything.

# Usage #

This is very simple : you instantiate a StarRating widget, you set the size of stars (SMALL,BIG) and the number of stars :

```
final StarRating sr = new StarRating(shell, SWT.NONE);
sr.setSizeOfStars(SIZE.SMALL);
sr.setMaxNumberOfStars(10);
```

And _voil√†_ !
