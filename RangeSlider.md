The Range Slider is a con­t­rol that lets you input two values, typically an upper and a lower bound. Normal sliders just lets you input one value.

# Usage #

Because the look and feel is very close to the [Scale widget](http://help.eclipse.org/helios/topic/org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/reference/api/org/eclipse/swt/widgets/Scale.html), I've decided to reproduce it.

The only difference concerns the "selection" getters and setters, because there is 2 values.

# Example #
